# Tic Tac React!
This repository contains my version of the Tic Tac Toe game that every beginner should do on the Reactjs.org website (for reference view: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I call it: _Tic-Tac-React!_ 

In my version, instead of doing all the coding for the game on a singular app.js or index.js page, I broke my source code up into their respective component files (Board.js, Game.js, Header.js, Square.js etc.). With this tutorial I refreshed my mind a bit on how to work with pure Reactjs, and, I even learnt how to import custom downloaded fonts from websites other than Google Fonts (which I'm extremely proud of)! This game is now fully functional, and I added a pulse transition to the squares that adds extra focus on the block on which the last move was made. I spent hours trying to create a modal using react-bootstrap to customize the player names, but each time it would not return correctly. 

Day one (1) of trying to code in React on my own was a success. I completed it with the following: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap.I completed it with the following: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap.

#### FUTURE NOTE: 
Custom player names instead of 'X' and 'O', and the ability to play against the computer instead are all functions that I will implement at a later stage once I have more time and understanding.
